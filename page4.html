            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>Walter White is an overqualified high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque in 2008. When his wife unexpectedly becomes pregnant with their second child, Walter's world collapses. The doctor has determined that he is terminally ill. Walter has lung cancer and seems likely to live for another 2 years at most. To ensure that his family does not end up in a financial crisis after his death and also to pay for his own treatments, Walter decides to turn to a life as a criminal. By doing the math carefully, Walter discovered that 737,000 American dollars would have to pay off all costs for the coming period after his death. With the help of Jesse Pinkman, a dropped out student he taught chemistry, he makes and sells the drug crystal meth. As he continues to teach, the importance of chemistry in modern society is prominent in his lessons. His product is more than 99% pure and this fact runs like a common thread throughout the entire series. However, Walter has to watch out for his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, who works for the DEA. His wife is also not allowed to know.</p>
