            <p>Hi, I'm Caspar and I'm from the Netherlands. I'm 20 years old and currently doing the college study Communication and Multimedia Design at the HvA, on the right you'll see a picture of our beautiful school. For one of my courses, Internet standaarden, I have to make a website with html and css so I decided to go for one that could find shows and movies for you and give you important infromation about them but more on that later.</p> 
            <p>I love to be creative and try out new things, drawing scetches in my note books and see what new things I can create, coding is something very new for me and I definitely need to practice a lot more since at the moment I still struggle a lot but I think it's very interesting and like to learn more.</p>

            <h2>The Website</h2>
            <p>Film Finder was originally planned to be a website where you could search up movies and shows and see where to watch them, if they were restricted to specific countries and aditional useful infromation. I got the idea from always having trouble figuring out where to watch movies I wanted to see and decided it was a good idea to see how far I would come. Of course I didn't expect to fully finish this website for this project but I did hope to see how much was possible and in the end it's still in a very very early stage, I noticed throughout the coding process it was a lot more complicated than I expected so at the moment the site is heavily limited and can only do a few things.</p>
            <p>For in the future I might try to slowly continue working on this website as I get better at coding but this of course will take some time and it won't be close to working well anytime soon. That doesn't mean you shouldn't take a look around the website, you might find yourself a new show you might like or find a movie you want to rewatch.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before the website is still in a very early stage and is very unfinished, so there will be some unfinished things around. First of all as you might have noticed we don't have a lot of contect at the moment, for now the only streaming service you can find is Netflix, once there only one of the "read more" buttons will be active. This is of course a great inconvenience but I am planning on working on this problem and adding more streaming services in the future.</p>

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>For the Future I am planning on adding a lot of extra features to the site, so far I came up with and will start working on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixing the Read more buttons</li>
                    <li>Adding more streaming services like HBO, Prime and Disney plus.</li>
                    <li>Adding more content and info for all the shows.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>For now this is what I mainly wanna focus on to improve the site but there will be much more to come in the future.</p>
