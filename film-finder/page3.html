            <h2>The Owner</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Caspar, and I'm from the Netherlands. I'm 20 years old and currently studying Communication and Multimedia Design at HvA College. For one of my courses, Internet Standaarden, I have to create a website using HTML and CSS. I decided to build a website that can help you find information about shows and movies, but more on that later.</p> 
            <p>I love to be creative and try out new things, like drawing sketches in my notebooks and experimenting with new ideas. Coding is something new for me, and I need more practice since I'm still learning, but I find it very interesting and enjoy learning more.</p>

            <h2>The Website</h2>
            <p>Film Finder was originally planned to be a website where you could search for movies and shows, see where to watch them, and find additional useful information. I got the idea from always having trouble figuring out where to watch the movies I wanted to see. I decided to see how far I could come with this project. While I didn't expect to fully finish this website, I hoped to explore its possibilities. However, throughout the coding process, I realized it was more complicated than expected. At the moment, the site is in a very early stage and can only do a few things.</p>
            <p>In the future, I might continue working on this website as I improve my coding skills, but it will take time to make it work well. That doesn't mean you shouldn't explore the website; you might discover new shows or find a movie to rewatch.</p>

        <section class="problems">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, the website is in an early stage and is unfinished, so you may encounter some incomplete features. Currently, the only streaming service available is Netflix, and only one of the "read more" buttons is active. I plan to work on this issue and add more streaming services in the future.</p>

        <section class="future">
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>In the future, I plan to add many extra features to the site. Some of my planned improvements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixing the "Read more" buttons</li>
                <li>Adding more streaming services like HBO, Prime, and Disney Plus</li>
                <li>Expanding content and information for all shows</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are my main focus areas for improving the site, but there will be much more to come in the future.</p>
